Project Title - Netflix Power BI Dashboard
1.	Introduction
- Hey there! This is my Netflix Dashboard — a full-blown visual deep-dive into the world’s biggest OTT platform, built in Power BI. Let’s be real — we all binge-watch Netflix, but ever wondered what makes its content tick across countries, genres, and time? That’s exactly what I wanted to unpack. 
2.	Business Problem
- Netflix has thousands of titles, and they’re spread across:
•	Movies and TV shows,
•	124+ countries,
•	40+ genres.
That’s a lot to track. And from a business point of view, Netflix needs to know:
•	What kind of content works best in which country?
•	Are movies outperforming TV shows or vice versa?
•	Which genres are killing it? Which ones are niche?
•	How are content formats evolving over time?
So, this dashboard solves that problem.
3.	Goal
•	Build a clean, professional, and interactive dashboard from scratch.
•	Give clear answers to business questions using Power BI, DAX, and the dataset.
•	Make it look vibey with that classic Netflix red-black aesthetic.
•	Sharpen my skills as a future-ready data analyst.
